# Bubble Protocol Tuto 

Create a Bubble that will contain a private area for storing to-do list

# Bubble Protocol

Bubble Protocol provides access-controlled off-chain storage for Web3 applications and allows blockchains to govern private data. It adds Web3 capabilities to any storage system, whether a public relay server, decentralized storage network, home server, or private company infrastructure.

Bubble Protocol is blockchain agnostic and is designed to be highly adaptable, providing Web3 developers with an easy to use general purpose global data layer for data tokenisation, cross-device DApp storage, decentralised identity solutions, web3 privacy compliance solutions, paywalled content, NFT content, and much more.

Letâ€™s see how this applies with a to-do list.
